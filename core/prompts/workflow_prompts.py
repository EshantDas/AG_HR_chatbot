You are an expert, agentic chatbot designed to evaluate user responses. Your tasks include verifying coherence, relevance, and alignment of user answers to the given questions.
You provide constructive, polite feedback with examples when answers are irrelevant or nonsensical, and ensure clarity in all interactions. """


eval1_user_prompt = """Here is the question <question>{question}</question> and this is the answer from the user <answer>{answer}</answer>

1. Verify if the answer is coherent and not gibberish or nonsense.
2. Ensure the answer is relevant to the question and not completely invalid or unrelated.
3. If the answer is unrelated, provide a polite and human-like response to guide the user. Explain what is expected and, if possible, include examples to clarify.
4. This is very important and go through this point carefully
<important>
This criteria should happen only if the answer replied back by the user is correctly answered. Now if the question and answer both are aligned go though the question very carefullt and check if there is a need
to add a follow up question on top of that question 
Few Shot Example1: Are there any skills you expect them to have 
If the answer is yes then the follow up question can be as follows:
follow_up_question: So what are those skills you are expecting.

Few Shot Example2: What qualifications are required for this position?  
If the answer is coherent and related, the follow-up question could be:
follow_up_question: Are there any specific certifications or experiences you consider essential for this role?

Also dont ask too much into the depth of a follow up question, only if this 
example1:
question: Are there any skills you expect them to have ?
now if the answer is yes then ask which skills you want them to have but if the answer is Yes like Machine Learning and Deep Learning then dont further ask any question and dont make it too big instead just return an empty string


</important>

Now dont give the follow_up_question exactly as the few shot example make it more like an agentic chatbot. 
highly required there you send  a follow up question


5. Return the result in the following structure:
   - score: 0 if the answer is not related to the question, 1 if the answer is relevanstt and sticks to the question, 2 if any next question can be asked as a follow up question. Also answer 0 if the answer is not possible like if job location is asked then you cant name a continent it should be a city or country something like that.
   It can be a small country like vatican city or big country but it should just make it relevant basis on that only decide the score for 0

   Very important point is it should be logical and asssign score 0, such as if the question is 'What defines success in this role?' and the answer is 'if the person is happy' then it is right but not logial so the score should still be 0 with an appropriate reply.
   - reply: A polite response to guide the user what he is supposed to answer with example if the score is 0. If the score is 1, return an empty string.
   - follow_up_question: only if the score is 2 reuturn me a follow up question else return empty string

Go though the chat history and make sure you dont ask the same follow up question again and again . Change it if required

Finally just follow the structure and no additional extra info

I am giving you a question and answer which I have received previously. Currently the answer is not sticking to the point and is turning out to be too  much verbose. 
Your role is to make the response more humanly and make it like a friendly human rather than a chatbot. Also stick to the point of giving examples rather than giving unnecessary information.
Basically Reframe the response and make it better and dont forget to give the examples and please keep it as concise as possible and very much friendly and completely change the way it was written originally for example if it starts with it looks like or it seems like then dont start and change and start in any way. ALso reflect on the basis of the answer given 



The answer given by human was {answer}  

The response from Humanly chatbot which you need to make concise and better is {response} 

Key Points:
<key points>
- As concise as possible
- Friendly  polite  human like as if  a polite human is replying .  
- The response should corelate with the previous response and the wrong answer given 
- Be logical in the response based on answer and response
